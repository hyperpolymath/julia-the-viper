"It's basically the same thing as an adder" -- Where a humble calculator becomes a quantum-ready security language
____

== Overview

*Julia the Viper* is a Harvard Architecture programming language designed to make code injection *grammatically impossible*. Named after mathematician Julia Robinson (Hilbert's 10th problem) with a playful nod to "adder" (snake + addition), JtV separates computation into two grammatically distinct channels:

* **Control Language**: Turing-complete, imperative (loops, conditionals, I/O)
* **Data Language**: Total/provably halting, addition-only expressions

This architectural separation ensures that user-supplied data can never contain control flow -- not through runtime validation, but through fundamental grammar design.

=== Why Addition-Only?

Addition is the *universal operation* across all number systems. Combined with Control loops, it achieves Turing-completeness while maintaining a provable termination guarantee when loops are absent.

Version 2 extends this to *reversible computing*, enabling quantum algorithm simulation where addition inverts to subtraction in `reverse` blocks.

== Quick Start

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Using Nix (recommended)
nix run github:Hyperpolymath/julia-the-viper

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/julia-the-viper.git
cd julia-the-viper
just build
just install
----

=== Your First Program

Create `hello.jtv`:

[source,julia-the-viper]
----
# Control Language: Turing-complete
Control {
    # Data Language: Total (guaranteed halting)
    let x = Data { 2 + 3 };

    print("Result: " + str(x));

    # Loops are Control-only
    for i in range(5) {
        let doubled = Data { i + i };
        print(doubled);
    }
}
----

Run it:

[source,bash]
----
jtv run hello.jtv
----

=== Harvard Architecture in Action

The killer feature is what you *cannot* write:

[source,julia-the-viper]
----
# ❌ GRAMMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
Data {
    if (user_input) {  # ERROR: Control flow in Data context
        malicious_code();
    }
}
----

Code injection isn't prevented by careful programming -- it's prevented by making it *grammatically impossible to express*.

== Key Features

=== 1. Grammatical Security

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Traditional Approach | Julia the Viper

| Runtime validation
| Compile-time grammar enforcement

| "Don't put user input in eval()"
| "User input grammatically cannot contain control flow"

| Security through discipline
| Security through architecture
|===

=== 2. Seven Number Systems

Full support for diverse numeric types:

* `Int`: `42`, `-17`
* `Float`: `3.14`, `2.718`
* `Rational`: `1/3`, `22/7`
* `Complex`: `3+4i`, `1.5-2.3i`
* `Hex`: `0xFF`, `0xDEADBEEF`
* `Binary`: `0b1010`, `0b11110000`
* `Symbolic`: `pi`, `e`, `golden_ratio`

All unified under addition operations with automatic type coercion.

=== 3. Pure Function Guarantee

[source,julia-the-viper]
----
# Only Pure Data Functions callable in Data context
pure fn square(x: Int) -> Int {
    Data { x + x }  # No loops/IO allowed
}

fn impure_calc(x: Int) -> Int {
    Control {
        print("Calculating...");  # Side effects
        Data { x + x }
    }
}

Control {
    let a = Data { square(5) };        # ✅ OK: Pure function
    let b = Data { impure_calc(5) };   # ❌ ERROR: Impure function
}
----

=== 4. Reversible Computing (v2)

Quantum algorithm simulation through operation inversion:

[source,julia-the-viper]
----
Control {
    let x = Data { 5 + 3 };  # x = 8

    reverse {
        x = Data { 5 + 3 };  # Inverted: x = 8 - 3 - 5 = 0
    }

    # x is now back to 0 (identity transformation)
}
----

Enables Bennett's trick, Grover's algorithm, and thermodynamically efficient computation per Landauer's principle.

=== 5. Smart Contract Security

Example ERC-20 token with provable properties:

[source,julia-the-viper]
----
Control {
    # Balance conservation: Total supply is constant
    invariant total_supply == sum(all_balances);

    # No reentrancy: Pure Data functions only
    # No overflow: Checked arithmetic in Data context
    # Guaranteed termination: Totality guarantee

    fn transfer(to: Address, amount: Int) {
        require(Data { balances[msg.sender] >= amount });

        # Atomic state transition
        balances[msg.sender] = Data {
            balances[msg.sender] + negate(amount)
        };
        balances[to] = Data { balances[to] + amount };

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
}
----

== Why "Julia the Viper"?

The name honors *Julia Robinson* (1919-1985), mathematician who contributed to solving Hilbert's tenth problem. "Viper" playfully references:

* **Adder**: A snake, also a calculator
* **Addition-only**: The core Data Language operation
* **Security**: Venomous to code injection attacks

The tagline "It's basically the same thing as an adder" embraces the humble pseudocode origins while acknowledging the sophisticated security model.

== Etymology & Humor

JtV embraces wordplay:

[quote]
____
Q: Why addition-only? +
A: It's *universal* with Control loops, yet *provably halts* without them.

Q: Isn't that limiting? +
A: You can implement multiplication, division, exponentiation... all through addition + loops.

Q: Why not just use Rust/Haskell/Coq? +
A: Legacy systems need retrofitting, not rewrites.
____

Maintain this lighthearted spirit while ensuring rigorous implementation.
