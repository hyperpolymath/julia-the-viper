# Security Guarantees
# Julia the Viper provides architectural security guarantees:
# - Code injection is grammatically impossible (Harvard Architecture)
# - No integer overflow in Data Language (checked operations)
# - No reentrancy attacks (atomic state updates)
# - Guaranteed termination for pure functions (totality checking)
#
# For vulnerability reporting guidelines, see:
# https://github.com/hyperpolymath/julia-the-viper/blob/main/SECURITY.md
#
# Response timeline:
# - Initial response: 48 hours
# - Critical issues patched: 7 days
# - Public disclosure: 15 days (coordinated)
