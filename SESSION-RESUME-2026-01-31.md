# Session Resume - Julia the Viper (2026-01-31)

## What Was Done Before the Crash

### Security & Compliance (Previous Session)
- ✅ SHA-pinned all GitHub Actions
- ✅ Created RFC 9116 compliant `.well-known/security.txt`
- ✅ Added `flake.nix` for Nix reproducible builds
- ✅ Created `.editorconfig` for code style consistency
- ✅ Fixed Clippy warning in `rsr_check.rs`
- ✅ Standardized licenses to PMPL-1.0-or-later
- ✅ Fixed author attribution to Jonathan D.A. Jewell
- ✅ Achieved RSR Gold standard (93%)

**Commits before crash:**
- `197933d` - chore: standardize licenses to PMPL-1.0-or-later and fix author attribution
- `f6c53bb` - feat: achieve RSR Gold standard (93%) with security & build improvements
- `85f5441` - feat: compiler infrastructure with WASM compilation working

## What Was Completed After Resume

### 1. Fixed License Inconsistency
- **Problem:** Workspace `Cargo.toml` still had `GPL-3.0-or-later` license
- **Fix:** Changed to `PMPL-1.0-or-later` for consistency
- **Commit:** `c9c4c17`

### 2. Pushed Unpushed Commits
- Pushed 4 commits that were ahead of origin/main
- All security fixes now on GitHub

### 3. Set Up Rust Toolchain for WASM
- Installed Rust stable as default toolchain
- Added `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Reshimmed asdf to pick up `wasm-pack`

### 4. WASM Compilation ✅
- **Successfully built** WASM package with `just build-wasm`
- Generated files in `pkg/`:
  - `jtv_core_bg.wasm` (413KB)
  - `jtv_core.js` (10KB)
  - `jtv_core.d.ts` (TypeScript declarations)
  - `package.json` (with PMPL-1.0-or-later license)
- Added LICENSE files to `pkg/` directory
- Fixed wasm-pack license warning

### 5. PWA Scaffold ✅
Created complete PWA infrastructure in `web/`:

**Files Created:**
- `index.html` - Beautiful gradient UI with:
  - Code editor panel
  - Output panel
  - WASM module loader
  - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
  - Service worker registration

- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest with:
  - App name: "Julia the Viper Playground"
  - Theme colors (purple gradient)
  - Icons configuration (192x192, 512x512)
  - Standalone display mode

- `sw.js` - Service worker with:
  - SPDX header (PMPL-1.0-or-later)
  - Cache-first strategy
  - Offline support for WASM and HTML

- `server.ts` - Deno HTTP server with:
  - Serves `web/` directory
  - Serves `pkg/` WASM files
  - Runs on port 8000

- `deno.json` - Task configuration:
  - `deno task serve` - Production server
  - `deno task dev` - Dev server with hot reload

**Justfile Recipes Added:**
- `just serve-pwa` - Build WASM and serve PWA
- `just dev-pwa` - Build WASM and serve with hot reload
- `just build-pwa` - Production build preparation

**Commits:**
- `54e1933` - feat: add PWA scaffold with Deno server and WASM integration
- `569ac28` - feat: add PWA-related justfile recipes

## Current State

### Completion Status
- **Overall:** 60% (up from 55%)
- **Phase:** Active Development
- **Working Features:**
  - RSR Gold compliance (93%)
  - WASM compilation
  - PWA scaffold with Deno server

### Next Immediate Priorities
1. **Router Visualization Demo** (THE KILLER FEATURE)
   - Animate Control (blue) vs Data (red) channel separation
   - Show "bridge" when data results cross to control variables
   - This teaches the Harvard Architecture concept visually

2. **WASM Function Bindings**
   - Expose parser/interpreter functions to JavaScript
   - Connect PWA UI to actual JtV execution

3. **PWA Enhancement**
   - Add manifest and service worker
   - Monaco editor integration
   - Number system explorer

### How to Run

```bash
# Build WASM
cd ~/Documents/hyperpolymath-repos/julia-the-viper
just build-wasm

# Serve PWA (production)
just serve-pwa

# Serve PWA (dev with hot reload)
just dev-pwa
```

Visit: http://localhost:8000/

### Repository Location
- **Canonical:** `~/Documents/hyperpolymath-repos/julia-the-viper/`
- **Physical:** `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/julia-the-viper/` (Eclipse drive)
- **Note:** Always use the symlink path for operations

## Key Files Modified
- `Cargo.toml` - License fix
- `STATE.scm` - Progress updates
- `Justfile` - PWA recipes
- `web/` - New PWA directory (5 files)

## Branch Status
- **Branch:** main
- **Status:** Up to date with origin/main
- **Latest commit:** `569ac28`
- **Unpushed:** None (all pushed)

## What Wasn't Started Yet
- Router visualization (HTML5 Canvas/SVG animation)
- Monaco editor integration
- WASM function exports for JS interop
- Number system explorer UI
- v2 features (reversibility, quantum)

## Notes for Next Session
1. The PWA is scaffolded but needs WASM function bindings
2. Router visualization should be the next focus (killer demo)
3. Current WASM build works but doesn't expose interpreter functions yet
4. The PWA UI is ready for hooking up actual JtV code execution
5. Service worker is registered but icons (192/512) need to be created

## Architecture Reminder
- **Control Language:** Turing-complete (blue channel)
- **Data Language:** Total/provably halting (red channel)
- **Security Model:** Code injection is grammatically impossible
- **The Pun:** "Viper" (snake) + "adder" (calculator) + Julia Robinson
