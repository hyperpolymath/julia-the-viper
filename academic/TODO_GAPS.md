## 3. Lean Proof Gaps

### 3.1 Proofs Using `sorry`

The following proofs in `jtv_proofs/` use `sorry` and need completion:

```lean
-- JtvOperational.lean:307
theorem data_terminates (e : DataExpr) (σ : State) :
    ∃ (n : Int), DataStepStar ⟨e, σ⟩ ⟨DataExpr.lit n, σ⟩ := by
  -- ... cases use sorry for step composition

-- JtvOperational.lean:362
example (σ : State) :
    ∃ σ', σ' ≠ σ ∧ CtrlStep ... := by
  -- Uses sorry for σ "x" ≠ 42 case
```

### 3.2 Missing Theorems

| Theorem | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `parser_correctness` | Not created | Parser produces valid AST |
| `interpreter_correctness` | Partial | Interpreter matches semantics |
| `wasm_compilation_correctness` | Not created | WASM output matches semantics |
| `full_type_inference` | Partial | Complete inference algorithm |
| `effect_soundness` | Not created | Effect system soundness |

### 3.3 Priority for Completion

1. **High Priority:**
   - Complete `data_terminates` proof
   - Add parser correctness theorem
   - Remove all `sorry` uses

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Effect system formalization
   - Type inference completeness
   - Reversibility completeness

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Category-theoretic formalizations
   - Advanced type features
