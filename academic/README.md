## Key Theorems

### Security

1. **Code Injection Impossibility** (SECURITY_PROOFS.md §2.3)
   - Code injection is grammatically impossible in JtV

2. **Non-Interference** (SECURITY_PROOFS.md §3.3)
   - High-security data cannot influence low-security outputs

3. **Data Sandboxing** (SECURITY_PROOFS.md §5)
   - Data Language has no write, I/O, or system capabilities

### Computability

1. **Data Language Totality** (COMPUTATIONAL_THEORY.md §2.1)
   - All Data expressions terminate

2. **Control Language Turing-Completeness** (COMPUTATIONAL_THEORY.md §1.4)
   - Control Language can simulate any Turing machine

3. **Decidability Separation** (COMPUTATIONAL_THEORY.md §2)
   - Termination decidable for Data, undecidable for Control

### Type Theory

1. **Type Safety** (TYPE_THEORY.md §3)
   - Progress + Preservation theorems

2. **Purity Enforcement** (TYPE_THEORY.md §5)
   - @pure/@total correctly restrict side effects

3. **Principal Types** (TYPE_THEORY.md §3.2)
   - Every well-typed expression has a principal type

### Reversibility

1. **Forward-Backward Identity** (QUANTUM_REVERSIBILITY.md §2.4)
   - Reversible operations compose to identity

2. **Quantum Gate Simulation** (QUANTUM_REVERSIBILITY.md §3)
   - Classical simulation of reversible/quantum gates
