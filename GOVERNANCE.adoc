== Overview

Julia the Viper follows a meritocratic governance model based on the Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF). This document describes decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities.

== Current State

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Julia the Viper v0.1.0* is currently in *Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)* mode.

We are actively seeking founding maintainers and trusted contributors.
====

== Governance Structure

=== Three-Tiered Model

Julia the Viper uses graduated trust perimeters to balance security with community participation:

[cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Perimeter | Access Level | Write Permissions | Current Status

| P1 (Core)
| Maintainers only
| Direct commit to `main`
| Not yet established

| P2 (Trusted)
| Vetted contributors
| Feature branches, requires review
| Not yet established

| P3 (Community)
| Anyone
| Fork and PR workflow
| *CURRENT*

== Decision-Making Process

=== Everyday Decisions

*Scope*: Bug fixes, documentation, code style, minor features

*Process*:

. Contributor submits PR
. Automated checks run
. P2 or P1 reviewer provides feedback
. Contributor addresses feedback
. P1 maintainer approves and merges

*Timeline*: 2-7 days

=== Feature Decisions

*Scope*: New language features, API changes, architectural decisions

*Process*:

. Proposal submitted as GitHub Issue with "RFC" label
. Community discussion (1-2 weeks)
. P1 maintainers discuss in private meeting
. Decision announced publicly with rationale
. Implementation PRs proceed

*Timeline*: 2-4 weeks

=== Strategic Decisions

*Scope*: Roadmap, funding, partnerships, major refactoring

*Process*:

. P1 maintainer proposes in maintainers mailing list
. Discussion period (2-4 weeks)
. Simple majority vote of P1 maintainers
. Public announcement with rationale

*Timeline*: 1-2 months

=== Emergency Decisions

*Scope*: Security vulnerabilities, critical bugs, infrastructure outages

*Process*:

. Any P1 maintainer can invoke emergency mode
. Fix implemented immediately
. Other P1 maintainers notified within 24 hours
. Retrospective held within 1 week
. Process improvements documented

*Timeline*: Immediate

== Voting Procedures

=== Voting Eligibility

* *P1 Decisions*: Only P1 maintainers vote
* *P2 Decisions*: P2 contributors have advisory vote, P1 decides
* *P3 Input*: Community input via discussions, no formal vote

=== Voting Thresholds

[cols="2,1,1"]
|===
| Decision Type | Threshold | Quorum

| Everyday (PRs)
| 1 approval (P1)
| N/A

| Feature proposals
| Simple majority (P1)
| 50% of P1

|===

=== Voting Process

. Proposal clearly documented
. Discussion period (varies by type)
. Vote called by any P1 maintainer
. Voting window: 7 days for normal, 72 hours for urgent
. Results announced publicly with rationale

=== Conflicts of Interest

Maintainers must recuse themselves from votes where they have conflicts:

* Financial interest in outcome
* Employer relationship
* Close personal relationship with proposer
* Prior public commitment to position

== Trust Escalation

=== P3 → P2 (Community → Trusted)

*Process*:

. Self-nomination or P1/P2 nomination
. Evidence: Link to 10+ quality PRs
. Interview: 30-minute video call with P1 maintainer
. Vote: Simple majority of P1 maintainers
. Announcement: Public recognition
. Access: Added to `trusted-contributors` team
. Onboarding: 2-week mentorship

*Timeline*: 2-4 weeks from nomination to decision

=== P2 → P1 (Trusted → Core)

*Process*:

. Nomination: Must be from existing P1 maintainer
. Evidence: 50+ quality PRs, 6+ months P2 tenure
. Background: Private discussion of long-term commitment
. Vote: Unanimous approval required
. Announcement: Public recognition
. Access: Added to `maintainers` team, granted signing keys
. Onboarding: 1-month mentorship

*Timeline*: 1-2 months from nomination to decision

== Trust De-Escalation

=== Inactive Contributors

* *P2 Inactive*: No activity for 6 months → moved to P3
* *P1 Inactive*: No activity for 12 months → moved to emeritus
* *Re-activation*: Can re-apply with simplified process

=== Code of Conduct Violations

* *Minor*: Warning, temporary P3-only access (1-4 weeks)
* *Moderate*: Suspension from P2/P1, moved to P3 (1-6 months)
* *Severe*: Permanent ban from all perimeters

See link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc] for enforcement procedures.

=== Performance Issues

If a P1/P2 member consistently:

* Misses review deadlines

* Causes interpersonal conflicts

*Process*:

. Private discussion with individual
. Performance improvement plan (30-90 days)
. Re-evaluation
. De-escalation or retention decision
