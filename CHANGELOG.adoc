== [Unreleased]

=== Planned for v0.2.0
- WASM code generation completion
- LSP server for editor support
- Type inference
- Performance optimizations

== [0.1.0] - 2025-01-22

=== Added
- **Core Language**
  - Complete Pest parser for Harvard Architecture (Control + Data languages)
  - Full AST implementation with all node types
  - Interpreter with execution engine
  - 7 number systems: Int, Float, Rational, Complex, Hex, Binary, Symbolic
  - Control flow: if/else, while, for, return
  - Function declarations with purity markers (@pure, @total)
  - Module system (basic)
  - Import statements
  - Error handling with detailed messages

- **Standard Library** (4 modules, 105+ functions)
  - `prelude.jtv`: Basic operations (abs, max, min, list ops)
  - `safe_math.jtv`: Checked arithmetic, GCD, primes, factorial
  - `collections.jtv`: List operations, sorting, searching, statistics
  - `result.jtv`: Error handling without exceptions

- **Examples** (17 programs)
  - 5 basic: hello addition, number systems, functions, loops, conditionals
  - 5 advanced: fibonacci, matrices, state machines, sorting, reversible computing
  - 5 smart contracts: NFT marketplace, DEX, DAO, multisig wallet, ERC-20 token
  - 2 integrations: Python and JavaScript examples

- **Tooling**
  - VS Code extension (syntax highlighting, 10+ snippets)
  - CLI tool (`jtv run`, `parse`, `check`, `analyze`)
  - TypeScript/Deno analyzer for legacy code analysis
  - Justfile with 25+ build commands

- **Testing**
  - 25+ parser tests
  - 10+ interpreter integration tests
  - Parser performance benchmarks
  - Interpreter performance benchmarks

- **Documentation** (15,000+ words)
  - README_JTV.md (comprehensive overview)
  - QUICK_START.md (getting started guide)
  - ROADMAP.md (development plan)
  - GRAMMAR_EVOLUTION.md (v1 vs v2 separation)
  - QUANTUM_VISION.md (reversible computing vision)
  - CONTRIBUTING.md (contribution guidelines)
  - STATUS.md (implementation tracking)
  - CLAUDE.md (AI assistant handover)

- **WASM Support**
  - wasm-bindgen integration
  - Browser and Node.js compatible bindings
  - JavaScript API (run, parse, get_variable, enable_trace)

- **RSR Compliance**
  - SECURITY.md (security policy)
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.1)
  - MAINTAINERS.md (governance structure)
  - CHANGELOG.md (this file)
  - .well-known/ directory (security.txt, ai.txt, humans.txt)
  - Dual licensing (GPL-3.0 + MIT)
  - TPCF perimeter definitions

=== Security
- Code injection grammatically impossible (Harvard Architecture enforcement)
- No integer overflow in Data Language (checked arithmetic)
- No reentrancy attacks (atomic operations)
- Guaranteed termination for pure functions (provable Totality)

=== Performance
- Target: 5-10x faster than Python for math-heavy functions
- Target: 3-5x faster than JavaScript for pure computations
- WASM compilation for near-native speed
- Parallel execution of pure functions

== [0.0.1] - 2025-01-21

=== Added
- Initial project structure
- Basic README
- GPL-3.0 LICENSE
- Pseudocode prototype (`julia-viper` file)
