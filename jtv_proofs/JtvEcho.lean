  Julia the Viper — Echo Types: Structured Loss / Non-Total Erasure

  This module formalises JtV's *Echo system* (spec v2, §8–9, §12) and aligns it
  with the `echo-types` Agda library (hyperpolymath/echo-types) and its
  executable companion `EchoTypes.jl`.

  PRINCIPLE: Echo is about *structured, proof-relevant loss* — information may
  be collapsed, weakened, sampled, projected, or degraded, but the
  residue / provenance / lineage of that loss is still representable. The fibre
  `Echo f y := Σ x, f x = y` is used not as a generic Σ-type but as the carrier
  of *retained-loss lineage*: it records which inputs were collapsed into `y`.

  An **Echo** classifies the loss behaviour of an operation:

    * `safe`     — no loss. The operation is injective / reversible; its fibre
                   over any output is a subsingleton, so lineage is trivial.
    * `neutral`  — *structured loss*. Information is collapsed, but the fibre
                   retains the loss lineage (non-trivial yet bounded).
    * `breaking` — *total erasure*. Lineage is destroyed; cannot be inverted.

  Lattice order:  `safe ⊑ neutral ⊑ breaking`  (join moves rightward, losing
  guarantees — mirroring the effect lattice `Total ⊑ Pure ⊑ Impure`).

  The headline result for the type checker is `blockEcho_admissible`: under the
  **Safe-only** reversal policy, a reverse block is admissible iff *every*
  constituent statement is `safe` (fully reversible). `neutral` (lossy but
  residue-retaining) and `breaking` are both rejected. This is the formal
  contract enforced by `crates/jtv-core/src/echo.rs`.

  Proofs are deliberately Mathlib-free (Lean core only) and discharge every
  goal by finite case analysis, matching the style of the other JtV proofs.

    reversal is not yet implemented) are rejected alongside `breaking`. Spec v2

-- SECTION 4: FIBRES — THE echo-types CORRESPONDENCE
-- ============================================================================

/-
  The `echo-types` library defines the echo of `f : A → B` at `y : B` as the
  fibre `Echo f y := Σ (x : A), f x ≡ y`. We reproduce that definition and
  prove the bridge between the *value-level* fibre and the *effect-level*
  Echo class above:

    * injective `f`            ↔  every fibre is a subsingleton   ↔  `safe`
    * non-injective, retained  ↔  fibre has ≥2 witnesses, bounded ↔  `neutral`
    * residue weakening        ↔  witnesses forgotten             ↔  loss is
                                                                     one-way
-/

/-- The fibre ("echo") of `f` at `y`: inputs mapping to `y`, paired with proof.
    This is the `echo-types` `Echo f y := Σ x, f x ≡ y`. -/
def Fibre {A B : Type} (f : A → B) (y : B) : Type := { x : A // f x = y }

/-- `echo-intro`: every input lives in the fibre over its own image. -/
def echoIntro {A B : Type} (f : A → B) (x : A) : Fibre f (f x) := ⟨x, rfl⟩

/-- `map-over`: a fibre of `g ∘ f` over `z` projects to a fibre of `g` over `z`. -/
def mapOver {A B C : Type} (f : A → B) (g : B → C) (z : C) :
    Fibre (g ∘ f) z → Fibre g z
  | ⟨x, h⟩ => ⟨f x, h⟩

/-- Injectivity, stated without Mathlib. -/
def Injective {A B : Type} (f : A → B) : Prop :=
  ∀ x₁ x₂ : A, f x₁ = f x₂ → x₁ = x₂

/-- **Safe ⇔ no loss.** If `f` is injective, every fibre is a subsingleton:
    the witness is uniquely recoverable, so the operation is reversible. -/
theorem injective_fibre_subsingleton {A B : Type} (f : A → B)

/-- **Structured loss is real and one-way.** There is a (non-injective) `f`
    whose fibre carries two distinct witnesses that the residue cannot tell
    apart — information genuinely lost, justifying the `neutral`/`breaking`
    classes rather than `safe`. -/

/-- Sanity check: the canonical reversible primitive (negation) is injective,
